List three data types used in this program.

    Strings, list, boolean 
    move = ' '
    dupeBoard = []
    gameIsPlaying = False
    

List any value variables or reference variables in this program.

    gameIsPlaying = True

Give an example of a sequence in this program.

         print('   |   |')
         print(' ' + board[7] + ' | ' + board[8] + ' | ' + board[9])
         print('   |   |')
         print('-----------')
         print('   |   |')
         print(' ' + board[4] + ' | ' + board[5] + ' | ' + board[6])
         print('   |   |')
         print('-----------')
         print('   |   |')
         print(' ' + board[1] + ' | ' + board[2] + ' | ' + board[3])
         print('   |   |')
         
Give an example of a condition in this program.
 
    if letter == 'X':
     return ['X', 'O']
    else:
     return ['O', 'X']
  
Give an example of an iteration in this program.

    for i in board:
     dupeBoard.append(i)
     
    return dupeBoard
 
Give an example of a list or collection in this program. What is saved in the list / collection?
 
    move = chooseRandomMoveFromList(board, [1, 3, 7, 9])
    if move != None:
     return move
  
Give an example of a function that has at least one parameter in this program. And, briefly explain what the function is trying to achieve.

        def playAgain():
         print('Do you want to play again? (yes or no)')
         return input().lower().startswith('y')
         
    This function determines if the user wants to play the game again
    
How does the program determine who wins the game? List the functions that the program use to determine the winner.
        
        The program compares all the winning boards to the current board and declares a winner             depending on the match.
        The fuctions used are "isWinner", "drawBoard"
        
If the code on line 165 is changed from break to gameIsPlaying = False, will this change the behaviour of the program?

    Doesnâ€™t change anything. There is a while loop while(gameIsPlaying), if gameIsPlaying is False the loop will end.

What does while True: do in this program?

    Starts an infinte loop that resets the board without any conditions to keep the game running despite the result of the game.
